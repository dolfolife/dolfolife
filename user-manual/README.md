This is a guide to Dolfo; a very quick tour of my personality and quirks.

The aim is to help you understand me better, to make our relationships easier and more fun and productive.

## Conditions I like to work in

## Times/Hours I like to Work

I live in the Central Time **timezone**, and I start my days from 7:30 AM to 8:00 AM. I take long breaks during the day and finish my day around 5:00 PM or 6:00 PM.

## Best ways to communicate with me

I have Slack on my phone to keep a channel of communication with my teams, colleges, and friends. You can find me on Kubernetes, Cloud Foundry or Knative Slack by `@dolfo`.

## How I best received feedback

I like written feedback followed with a conversation around topics I might not understand. Also, I like feedback I can act on so I can get better at what I do.
