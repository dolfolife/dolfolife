# Resume

I made these files to build a LaTex file to PDF using [AltaCV](https://github.com/liantze/AltaCV) class. Kudos to [liantze](https://github.com/liantze) for making this class.

There is no real reason, yet, why building my resume using LaTex with [TinyTeX](https://yihui.org/tinytex/), but it was fun to remember college times when LaTeX was the default format for our assignments.

You can find my latest resume at [Releases](https://github.com/dolfolife/dolfolife/releases).

If you want to build your own I recommend following [DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md).
