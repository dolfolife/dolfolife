# Things I read

I enjoy reading and I am interested in what people have to say about their experiences. I am going to split my reading material into 3 blocks - Software Engineering, Engineering Management, and personal interests.

## Software Engineering material

I like to read about patterns, problems, and ways of thinking other programmers have done in the past. I struggle reading books about a specific language or tools. I have a mix of audiobooks and books I like to read over and over again, but here is a list of the top books I can remember off top of my head:

- [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/)
- [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321)
- [The Art of Computer Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming)
- [Staff Engineer: Leadership beyond the management track](https://staffeng.com/book)
- [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612)

## Management

As an Engineering Manager, I focused a lot of time on team cohesion, coaching, mentoring, and leading teams in the projects I have on the horizon. Team identity is important to me, and I like to spend time with my team to make sure we are aligned on the same goals. Here is a list of books I remember when I think about management:
